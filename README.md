 * Rules:
 * 
 * Rule 1 
 * Only change the class 'MyGreep'. No other classes may be modified or created. 
 *
 * Rule 2 
 * You cannot extend the Greeps' memory. That is: you are not allowed to add 
 * fields (other than final fields) to the class. Some general purpose memory is
 * provided. (The ship can also store data.) 
 * 
 * Rule 3 
 * You can call any method defined in the "Greep" superclass, except act(). 
 * 
 * Rule 4 
 * Greeps have natural GPS sensitivity. You can call getX()/getY() on any object
 * and get/setRotation() on yourself any time. Friendly greeps can communicate. 
 * You can call getMemory() and getFlag() on another greep to ask what they know. 
 * 
 * Rule 5 
 * No creation of objects. You are not allowed to create any scenario objects 
 * (instances of user-defined classes, such as MyGreep). Greeps have no magic 
 * powers - they cannot create things out of nothing. 
 * 
 * Rule 6 
 * You are not allowed to call any methods (other than those listed in Rule 4)
 * of any other class in this scenario (including Actor and World). 
 *  
 * If you change the name of this class you should also change it in
 * Ship.createGreep().
 * 
 * Please do not publish your solution anywhere. We might want to run this
 * competition again, or it might be used by teachers to run in a class, and
 * that would be ruined if solutions were available.
